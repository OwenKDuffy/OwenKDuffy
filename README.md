## Some of my stuff
### Kings Online
[KingsCup](https://owenkduffy.github.io/KingsCup/Kings.html)

Ditch the physical cards and embrace modernity with an online version of the classic party game! Gather a bunch of your friends and play a game of Kings using a simulated deck of cards and customisable rules so you can tailor the experience to your own tastes.
